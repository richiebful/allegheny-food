SW Pennsylvania Food
====================

Maps food deserts, farms, grocery stores, and restaurants in Allegheny and the surrounding Counties

#To-do#

- now that farmer data extraction (from Farm Payment Database) has been generalized, let's do it for all available years, to make sure we reach everyone
- batch search yellow/white pages (farms likely just as individuals) for phone numbers
- make survey (probably for serving over Google Forms, and potentially as a live phone survey)
- generate script for survey, given that the sample isn't in the many hundreds
- contact USDA offices, county extensions, grange, 4H to put up something in their bulletin/email newsletter
